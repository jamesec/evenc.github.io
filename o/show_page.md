# Show me this page
`Apr 29, 2024`

Today I made some changes to this website. 

Originally I use a pair of `.htm` and `.md` files to parse the markdown file and show the page.

For example, `this_page.htm` and `this_page.md`.

But now, I only use a single html page to parse all the markdown files.

A page link will be like: `s.htm?p=this_page`

It means, **s**how me the **p**age :-D
- `s.htm` means <u>s(how)</u>.htm
- `p=this_page` means the <u>p(age)</u> is `this_page`

Also, I added a function that set the page title to be the h1 plus my name, when parsing the markdown file.

You can use `View Page Source` to check the codes.

Actually I knew almost nothing about JavaScript, so I asked ChatGPT and learned how to do these!
