# Show me the page

Today I made some changes to this website. 

Originally I use a pair of `.htm` and `.md` files to parse the markdown file and show the page.

For example, `show_page.htm` and `show_page.md`.

But now, I only use a single html page to parse all the markdown files.

The page url will be like: `s.htm?p=show_page`

It means, **s**how me the **p**age :-D
- `s.htm` means <u>s(how)</u>.htm
- `p=something` means the <u>p(age)</u> is something

The code with comments is here:

<pre>
  <code class="language-css">
    img {
      display: block;
      width: 100%;
      height: auto;
    }
  </code>

Actually I knew almost nothing about JavaScript, so I asked ChatGPT and learned how to do this, by chatting with AI, it's helpful, thanks.
