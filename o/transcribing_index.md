# Transcribing

Most of the transcripts of the videos are generated by AI, and there are minor errors, so I verify and correct them. 

For example, download the subtitle via https://downsub.com/, into a text file, and then ask ChatGPT to do some preparation work:<br>
`DON'T change any of the original text, but just add commas and periods, break the following into paragraphs, according to the groups of meaning.`

Then I manually verify and correct those errors.

- [One True Morty, Rick and Morty, by Adult Swim](s.htm?p=morty)
- [Emotional deepening process, by Robert Elliott](s.htm?p=deepening)
- [Different kinds of emotional responses in EFT, by Robert Elliott](s.htm?p=emotions)
- [How Robert Elliott came to EFT](s.htm?p=robert_eft)
- [No writer's block for Sue, by Seth Godin](s.htm?p=no_block)
- [Radical acceptance, by Ann Weiser Cornell](s.htm?p=radical)
